# Automated-Repository-Creater
This repository has the code for creating an automated repository with the help of Puppeteer and NodeJs.

We have all wanted to create Repository on GitHub using just our command line and we do have some APIs and curl commands for the same, but here is a cool project which helps create automated repositories and returns the address of the link to use the repository for further git commands.

The code has the follwoing:
 1. credentials.json - A JSON file which has the details of your account.
 2. filedetails.json - A JSON file which has the details of the repository which will be used in creating the repository.
 3. script.js - It is the code file written in Javascript that needs to be executed in order to use the features of the program.
 4. run.sh / run.bat - These are the executable files, which need to be executed in order to run the code. ".sh" and ".bat" work for linux and windows based systems respectively.

 After successfull execution, we recieve the link which can be used to work further.
